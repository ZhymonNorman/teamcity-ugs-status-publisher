# ugs-status-publisher

## Introduction

This is a fork that has slight changes to be compatible with a [Python UGS Server](https://github.com/thejinchao/py-ugs-server). Be sure and checkout the upstream [READ_ME](https://github.com/jorgenpt/teamcity-ugs-status-publisher#readme) for in-depth details.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Due to the changes made it is unknown if compatibility with the [Rust UGS](https://github.com/jorgenpt/rugs) server still works.
